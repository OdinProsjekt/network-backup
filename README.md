Simple replacement for RANCID

Since RANCID is a bit rancid, I've decided to make an alternative with git and ruby.

TODO:
* Stop using system()
* make sure remote commands are properly escaped
* implement configuration-options for the various mapping-functions
* autodetect git-pushable repos and allow auto-push
